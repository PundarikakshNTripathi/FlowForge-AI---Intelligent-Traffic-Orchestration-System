# FlowForge AI - Intelligent Traffic Orchestration System

FlowForge AI is a smart traffic control system designed to optimize urban mobility using real-time computer vision and reinforcement learning. Built for the Smart India Hackathon, this project aims to reduce congestion, improve signal efficiency, and enable intelligent traffic orchestration across intersections.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Vehicle detection using computer vision (YOLOv8 / OpenCV)
- Adaptive signal control via reinforcement learning (DQN / PPO)
- Real-time traffic flow analysis
- Scalable architecture for multi-intersection deployment

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, PyTorch
- FastAPI (for backend APIs)
- React (for dashboard visualization)
- Render (for deployment)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PundarikakshNTripathi/FlowForge-AI.git
cd FlowForge-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
