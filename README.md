## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended - Automatic Deployment)

**Option 1: Direct Git Integration (Simplest)**
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Create React App configuration
4. Click "Deploy" - automatic HTTPS URL will be generated
5. Any future commits to main branch will auto-deploy

**Option 2: Manual Deployment**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Netlify
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Drag & drop 'build' folder to Netlify
# Or use Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
```

### Manual Hosting
```bash
# Create production build
npm run build

# Upload 'build' folder to any static hosting service
# (AWS S3, Azure Static Web Apps, GitHub Pages)
```

### CI/CD Note
This project uses **Vercel's native Git integration** for deployment instead of GitHub Actions. This approach is:
- ✅ **Simpler**: No secrets configuration required
- ✅ **More reliable**: Direct integration with Vercel's platform
- ✅ **Automatic**: Deploys on every commit to main branch
- ✅ **Zero-config**: Works out of the box with Create React App

Previous GitHub Actions workflows have been removed to eliminate CI/CD pipeline conflicts.
